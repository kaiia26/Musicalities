# Song Journal
“Music has been a unifying force for humanity across centuries and backgrounds. "Song Journal" is an interactive app that integrates with Spotify to load your playlist and aligns the songs with your mood and time of day, and allows you to write about a glimpse of your day with a journal feature. Song Journal also features an interactive calendar, enabling you to revisit your musical journey at any point in time. This dynamic calendar not only allows you to view your daily activities but also illustrates how your music preferences evolve over time. Each day is colorfully painted with the songs that defined it. The "Song of the Day" is prominently displayed, inviting you to reflect on how it influenced your emotions and experiences. This feature transforms the Song Journal into more than just an app; it becomes a time capsule of your musical journey, waiting to be opened and explored. It highlights the "Song of the Day" and includes an entry where you can express how the song resonates with you and impacts your day. It becomes your personal companion, quite literally, with additional features like crafting your very own character. Embark on a journey full of vibrant experiences with your very own Song Journal!”
